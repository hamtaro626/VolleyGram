# Volleyball Rotation Reference — v0.1

## The job

Open it courtside on my phone, pick a rotation, see where all six players
stand at the moment of serve.

## Decisions

- **System:** 4-2. Two setters, opposite each other, setter always front row.
- **Formations:** Base rotation only — legal starting positions at serve.
- **Device:** Phone first. Must work one-handed, standing up, in a gym.
- **No backend.** No accounts, no saving, no database. Static files only.

## Roles

Six players, three pairs:

| Code | Role |
|------|------|
| S1, S2 | Setters |
| MB1, MB2 | Middle blockers |
| OH1, OH2 | Outside hitters |

## Starting lineup

Listed in rotation order, starting at slot 1:

```
S1, MB1, OH1, S2, MB2, OH2
```

The setters are three slots apart. That gap is what guarantees exactly one
setter is front row in all six rotations — the whole point of a 4-2.

## Court slots

Volleyball's numbering, net at the top:

```
  4   3   2     front row
  5   6   1     back row  (1 serves)
```

Players rotate clockwise: 2→1, 1→6, 6→5, 5→4, 4→3, 3→2.

## v0.1 does

- Show the court with net and attack line
- Show six labeled players at their base positions
- Switch between rotations 1–6 (tap a number, or prev/next)
- Highlight which setter is front row
- Drag a player to adjust, and reset back to base

## v0.1 does NOT do — on purpose

These are all good ideas. They are not v0.1.

- Serve receive formations
- Defensive formations
- The setter's switch to the setting position after contact
- Overlap-legality checking
- Editing the lineup or naming real players
- Saving anything between sessions
- 5-1 or 6-2 systems
